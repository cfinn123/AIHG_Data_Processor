## Analysis considerations

- Compare the Ct values to expected threshold for each of three reactions (N1, N2, RNaseP)
  - N1 and N2 reactions need to meet a specific Ct threshold (per refernce document <= 40) to determine result. Reactions that amplify at <40 40 cycles are positive
  - A log is made where the Ct values from NTC (negative), HSC (extraction), and nCoVPC (positive) controls from each plate are recorded
