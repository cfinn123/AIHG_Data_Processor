# covid19

## Analysis considerations

- Compare the Ct values to expected threshold for each of three reactions (N1, N2, RNaseP)
  - N1 and N2 reactions need to meet a specific Ct threshold (per CDC reference document < 40) to qualify as positive result. 
  - A log is made detailing experiment information and the Ct values from NTC (negative), HSC (extraction), and nCoVPC (positive) controls.
