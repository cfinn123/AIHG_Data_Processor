## Analysis considerations

- Compare the Ct values to expected threshold for each of the 4 reactions
  - RNase P should always be positive
  - N1, N2, N3 reactions need to meet a specific Ct threshold to determine result. Reactions that are <= threshold are positive
  - Logs should be made where the Ct values from the positive template control (PTC) from each plate is recorded
